Cleanup:
- 'const float*[4]' -> 'lua_Vec' ?

Issues:
- should luaO_rawequalObj() in lobject.c have a case for LUA_TVEC?
- binary compatibility with standard lua? type indices have changed, so binaries compiled with
  standard luac probably don't work with lua-vec interpreter
- vec[idx] accessor operator calls luaG_typeerror(L, t, "index") when trying to access with an
  invalid index (number out of bounds or bad string like "foo"); however "index" may not be the
  proper error type for these incidents (see lvm.c function luaV_gettable)
